# Random Rename
Small little program for a Dolphin service menu to rename images to a random
string of ASCII-letter characters.

### Why Would I Use This?
Occasionally when saving pictures from the Internet, you may run into files with
non-unique names. (e.g., ``image0.jpg``) Saving and renaming these can get
annoying and ugly. Instead of 'manually' renaming them to ``image0 (1).jpg`` and
``image0 (2).jpg``, this can instead rename each to a reasonably unique string
of characters. For instance, ``NogbaHbAkz.jpg`` and ``zRfGqHooXs.jpg``.
